# Starter Kitty

Starter Kitty is a collection of common utilities and packages for JavaScript projects. It is designed to provide sensible defaults for common tasks, such as file system operations and input validation.

## Why `starter-kitty`?

This package provides a set of components that are safe-by-default, so you can focus on building your app without worrying about common security footguns.
